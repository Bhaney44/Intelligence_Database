Trust is introduced into the policy-based system by assigning a value to each execution of each policy with respect to the policy-based system, called the instantaneous trust index. The instantaneous trust indices for each one of the policies, for the each execution of a given policy or for both are combined into the overall trust index for a given policy or for a given policy-based system. The recommended actions are processed in accordance with the level or trust associated with a given policy as expressed by the trust indices. Manual user input is provided to monitor or change the recommended actions. In addition, reinforcement learning algorithms are used to further enhance the level of trust between the user and the policy-based system."

The system includes a model which receives an input (e.g., from a user) and provides a probability distribution associated with uncertainty regarding parameters of the model to a decision engine. The decision engine can determine whether to exploit the information known to it or to explore to obtain additional information based, at least in part, upon the explore-vs.-exploit tradeoff (e.g., Thompson strategy).

The application of wavelet aided RL based controller represents a paradigm shift in the control of large scale stochastic dynamic systems of which the control problem is a subset. The control strategy is termed a WRL-RbR controller. The WRL-RbR controller is tested on a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) process of wafer fabrication for which process model is available. Results show that the RL controller outperforms EWMA based controllers for low autocorrelation. The new controller also performs quite well for strongly autocorrelated processes for which the EWMA controllers are known to fail. Convergence analysis of the new breed of WRL-RbR controller is presented. Further enhancement of the controller to deal with model free processes and for inputs coming from spatially distributed environments are also addressed.

Advantage updating is a direct learning technique; it does not require a model to be given or learned. It is incremental, requiring only a constant amount of calculation per time step, independent of the number of possible actions, possible outcomes from a given action, or number of states. Analysis and simulation indicate that advantage updating is applicable to reinforcement learning systems working in continuous time (or discrete time with small time steps) for which Q-learning is not applicable. Simulation results are presented indicating that for a simple linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem with no noise and large time steps, advantage updating learns slightly faster than Q-learning. When there is noise or small time steps, advantage updating learns more quickly than Q-learning by a factor of more than 100,000. Convergence properties and implementation issues are discussed.

The system detects talking segments by classifying talking and non-talking segments in a sequence of image frames using visual cues. The present disclosure detects temporal segments of talking faces in video sequences by first localizing face, eyes, and hence, a mouth region. Then, the localized mouth regions across the video frames are encoded in terms of integrated gradient histogram (IGH) of visual features and quantified using evaluated entropy of the IGH. The time series data of entropy values from each frame is further clustered using online temporal segmentation (K-Means clustering) algorithm to distinguish talking mouth patterns from other mouth movements. Such segmented time series data is then used to enhance the emotion recognition system."

Most practical approaches use a heuristic, typically gradient-descent, algorithm to search for a solution in the huge space of possible solutions. Such methods are by definition sensitive to starting points. It has been well-known that clustering algorithms are extremely sensitive to initial conditions. Most methods for guessing an initial solution simply make random guesses. In this paper we present a method that takes an initial condition and efficiently produces a refined starting condition. The method is applicable to a wide class of clustering algorithms for discrete and continuous data. In this paper we demonstrate how this method is applied to the popular K-means clustering algorithm and show that refined initial starting points indeed lead to improved solutions. The technique can be used as an initializer for other clustering solutions. The method is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution and runs in time guaranteed to be less than overall clustering time for large data sets. The method is also scalable and hence can be efficiently used on huge databases to refine starting points for scalable clustering algorithms in data mining applications."
